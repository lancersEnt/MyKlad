# MyKlad GraphQL Microservices API

This project is [Multi-Repo] project containing a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API with [Apollo_federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/), [Apollo_Gateway](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/v1/gateway/) back-end microservices using [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) as a stream-processing plateform, built using the [NestJS_framework](https://nestjs.com/).
This project is created as an end of study project and is used mainly for learning purposes.

## Graph Model

When creating GraphQL APIs, one must understand what [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) and Graph Data Modelling are. One must also [think in graphs](https://graphql.org/learn/thinking-in-graphs/) as per the GraphQL specification recommends. A diagram of the graph data model is shown below.
